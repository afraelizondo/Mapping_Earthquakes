## Overview

In this project, we worked in data visualization with interactive features in a non profit organization that provides data driven stories about natural disasters around the world. The performance was specifically of earthquakes maps. These maps are gonna be displayed in the US geological service website and in the mobile app. 

The coordinates and magnitudes were retrieved using JavaScript, D3, as well as leaflet library, for plotting the data was used mapbox.

Each earthquake contains a pop up marker that shows its magnitude and precise location, the color and size the circles of each earthquake have is related with the magnitude. 

## Main objective
